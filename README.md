### **Installation:**
1. Clone this repository

3. For the seventh and the "email" exercises:
   1. install `node.js`:
   *  if you have already installed `node.js` you can skip this passage
   * you can check it typing in the terminal `node -v`: if this command returns the `node.js` version, you can skip this passage, otherwise:
      * go to [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), dowload and install it
   2. install "nodemailer": in you terminal, write: `npm i nodemailer` 
   3. from the project folder, start the exercises typing in your terminal:
   * `node ./build/ex7.js` for exercise 7
   * `node ./build/email.js` for email exercise

### **Additional info:**
- Ethereal (used in the seventh and in the "email" exercise) is a fake SMTP service, completely free anti-transactional email service where messages never get delivered. It helped me fix the "concurrent connections limit exceeded" error that occurred every time trying to send emails from an outlook account to more than two users.
